Python has a set of coding conventions, also known as the "PEP 8 style guide",
that provide a consistent and readable style for Python code. These conventions
cover topics such as naming conventions, code structure, whitespace usage, and commenting.
Here are some of the key points from the PEP 8 style guide:

Naming Conventions:

Class names should be in CamelCase (e.g. MyClass).
Function and variable names should be in lowercase with words separated by underscores (e.g. my_function, my_variable).
Constants should be in uppercase with words separated by underscores (e.g. MY_CONSTANT).
Code Structure:

Indentation should be 4 spaces. Tabs should not be used.
Lines should be limited to a maximum of 79 characters.
Functions and classes should be separated by two blank lines.
Within functions, blocks of code should be separated by a single blank line.
Whitespace:

Surround binary operators with a single space on either side.
Use spaces around assignment operators.
Do not use spaces around the = in keyword arguments.
Comments:

Use # for inline comments.
Use triple-quoted strings for multiline comments or docstrings.
Write meaningful and clear comments that explain the purpose of code.

By following these conventions, you can make your code easier to read and understand
for other developers. However, it's important to note that the most important thing
is to be consistent in your style and to make sure that your code is readable and maintainable.
